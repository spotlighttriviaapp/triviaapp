# Tools needed:

# Workflow
1. Checkout `development` branch.
2. Add your changes.
3. Push changes to github.
4. When enough changes are accumulated in development that we want to go live, merge development branch into main.

* Note: a github workflow is setup to automatically build and deploy the main branch to firebase when a branch is merged into main.
