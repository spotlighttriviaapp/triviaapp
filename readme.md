# Tools needed:
node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
firebase: npm install firebase

# Workflow
1. Create a branch off of development.
2. Add your changes to your branch.
3. Create a pull request into development.
4. When enough changes are accumulated in development that we want to go live, merge development branch into main.

* Note: a github workflow is setup to automatically build and deploy the main branch to firebase when a branch is merged into main.
